# Zach-s-Website

This is a styled and improved version of the minimalistic website inspired by [zachlatta.com](https://zachlatta.com).

## About

The original site was intentionally simple with no CSS. For the Summer of Making challenge, I enhanced the project by adding custom CSS to create a clean, modern, and visually appealing design while keeping the content and structure intact.

## Features

* Fully styled with custom CSS
* Responsive and clean layout
* Improved typography and spacing
* Maintains the original simple HTML structure

## How to Use

* Clone or download the repository.
* Open `index.html` in your browser to see the styled website.
* Modify the HTML or CSS files to customize the look and content further.

 #### Or

* Visit https://f58igx-kodes.github.io/Zach-s-Website/ for a demo.
